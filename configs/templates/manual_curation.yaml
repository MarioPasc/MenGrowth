# Manual curation exclusions — applied after automated pipeline
# Usage: mengrowth-curate-dataset --config configs/raw_data.yaml --final-manual-curation configs/templates/manual_curation.yaml
#
# Each exclusion removes one study from the curated dataset.
# After all removals, patients with fewer than min_studies_per_patient studies
# are automatically removed as well.
#
# Fields:
#   patient_id (required): MenGrowth patient ID
#   study_id   (required): MenGrowth study ID
#   reason     (required): Human-readable reason for exclusion
#   sequence   (optional): Modalities where the issue was observed, e.g. [t1c] or [t1c, t2w]
